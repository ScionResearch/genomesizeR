PACKAGE:
- Acronyms? Steve: "Trying to get a good backronym... MAGIC â€“ Microbiome Average Genome Size Inference Calculation
IMAGINE - Inference of Microbial Average Genome Size In Next Generation eDNA libraries"
- Make databases and models available online (Celine)
- re-run models with updated databases (Celine/Joane)
- update methods comparison with results with updated databases (Joane)
- Make output similar across methods:
    - concordant columns (Celine) DONE?
    - fixed query column for weighted_mean output (Celine) DONE?
- Re-do model selection on Bayesian method with final db version (Joane -> do after pre-print)
- Test on Windows and BFC (Celine)
- Clean/handle prerequisites (Celine)
- Update and check all the documentation (Celine)
- Clean the code (Celine)
- Do the R checks (Celine)
- Double check how ref db is built and what it means for INFO_NODE check (and document) (Celine)
- One day maybe: scripts to build db and bayesian models from scratch (Celine)

PAPER:
- update methods comparisons with new figures from updated databases (Joane)
- Write a paragraph about method comparison? (Joane?)
- for pandoc compilation: change multiline equations into align* (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63350182/pandoc-not-generating-new-lines-in-markdown-with-latex) (Joane) (probably waiting for push)
- re-float figures to the right place (Joane)
- for pandoc compilation: in example, get code to fit into page (Celine)
- get intro from Steve: Done, clean and handle refs
- update references (from Steve's blurb? + do we need to cite anything related to NCBI?)
- remove template/instruction sections
- finish/rework example
