PACKAGE:
- Acronyms? Steve: "Trying to get a good backronym... MAGIC â€“ Microbiome Average Genome Size Inference Calculation
IMAGINE - Inference of Microbial Average Genome Size In Next Generation eDNA libraries"
- Make databases and models available online (Celine)
- Run methods on validation set and update method comparison with updated databases (Celine for weighted mean/Joane)
- Make output similar across methods:
    - concordant columns (Celine) DONE? Yes - apart from match rank. the order of the columns in common is not the same (but I am chipotting)
    - add match rank information in lmm and bayesian methods? or too much work? (maybe after pre-print)
    - Related: LMM behaviour: discuss how/if to prevent prediction when no refs under order that generates identical spurious predictions (Celine and Joane)
- Re-do model selection on Bayesian method with final db version (Joane -> do after pre-print)
- Test on Windows and BFC (Celine)
- Update and check all the documentation, should be ok now (Celine)
- Clean the code, should be ok (Celine)
- Document more the output in vignette
- Do the R checks, ok but do again before publishing (Celine)
- Double check how ref db is built and what it means for INFO_NODE check (and document) (Celine): INFO_NODE True only if node had information, and no propagation
- Related to above: Behaviour with INFO_NODE nodes is different between weighted_mean and the other methods
- Clean committed files (Celine)
- Behaviour is weird with multithreaded (takes longer instead of shorter??) (Celine)
- One day maybe: scripts to build db and bayesian models from scratch (Celine)

PAPER:
- update methods comparisons with new figures from updated databases (Joane)
- update all figures and data
- Write a paragraph about method comparison? (Joane?)
- re-float figures to the right place (Joane)
- author list: add Steve and Loretta?
- show boxplot?
- for final paper: could check correlation with variables from original paper
- for final paper: I think it could be cool to make a table summarizing pros and cons of each method
