PACKAGE:
- Joane to check that dbs are all good through methods comparison from the example using the package
- Make databases and models available online (Celine)
- Run methods on validation set and update method comparison with updated databases (Celine for weighted mean/Joane)
- LMM behaviour: Joane to identifiy threshold to remove lmm estimations above family (not possible apparently)
- Test on Windows and BFC (Celine)
- Vignette about methods, weighted mean: add figure of example graph (Celine)
- Document more the output in vignette
- In input/output vignette, add an example using phyloseq data
- Do the R checks, ok but do again before publishing (Celine)
- Behaviour is weird with multithreaded (takes longer instead of shorter??) (Celine)
- One day maybe:
    - add rank match info for lmm and bayesian methods
    - scripts to build db and bayesian models from scratch (Celine)
    - Re-do model selection on Bayesian method with final db version (Joane -> do after pre-print)

PAPER PREPRINT:
- Joane: finish bayesian and lmm CI desciption
- fix or delete CI formula in wm method description (Joane + Celine)
- re-float figures to the right place (Joane)
- add methods comp section after example: figure (Joane) (CI comparison figure updated and combined by Celine) and pro/cons table (Joane + Celine)


PAPER FINAL
- update methods comparisons with validation with new figures from updated databases (Joane)
- could check correlation with variables from original paper
