PACKAGE:
- Try putting on Bioconductor? (Celine)
- Fix dependencies (Celine)
- Run methods on validation set and update method comparison with updated databases (Celine for weighted mean/Joane)
- Vignette about methods, weighted mean: add figure of example graph (Celine)
- Document more the output in vignette
- In input/output vignette, add an example using phyloseq data
- Multithreading behaviour is weird (Celine)
- One day maybe:
    - add rank match info for lmm and bayesian methods
    - scripts to build db and bayesian models from scratch (Celine)
    - Re-do model selection on Bayesian method with final db version (Joane -> do after pre-print)

PAPER FINAL
- update methods comparisons with validation with new figures from updated databases (Joane/Celine)
- could check correlation with variables from original paper (Celine)
