PACKAGE:
- Acronyms? Steve: "Trying to get a good backronym... MAGIC â€“ Microbiome Average Genome Size Inference Calculation
IMAGINE - Inference of Microbial Average Genome Size In Next Generation eDNA libraries"
- Make databases and models available online (Celine)
- Check suspicious identical predictions with lmm method (Joane)
- Run methods on validation set and update methods comparison with updated databases (Celine for weighted mean/Joane)
- Make output similar across methods:
    - concordant columns (Celine) DONE? Yes - apart from match rank. the order of the columns in common is not the same (but I am chipotting)
    - add match rank information in lmm and bayesian methods? or too much work? (maybe after pre-print)
    - Related: LMM behaviour: discuss how/if to prevent prediction when no refs under order (Celine and Joane)
- Re-do model selection on Bayesian method with final db version (Joane -> do after pre-print)
- Test on Windows and BFC (Celine)
- Clean/handle prerequisites (Celine)
- Update and check all the documentation (Celine) pseudo code in documentation?
- readme: change github address when ready (it is set on the old repo) (Celine)
- Clean the code (Celine)
- Do the R checks (Celine)
- Double check how ref db is built and what it means for INFO_NODE check (and document) (Celine)
- Related to above: Behaviour with INFO_NODE nodes is probably different between weighted_mean and the other methods
- One day maybe: scripts to build db and bayesian models from scratch (Celine)

PAPER:
- update methods comparisons with new figures from updated databases (Joane)
- Write a paragraph about method comparison? (Joane?)
- re-float figures to the right place (Joane)
- for pandoc compilation: in example, get code to fit into page (Celine)
- properly code references from  .bib file
- do we need to cite anything related to NCBI?
- remove template/instruction sections
- finish/rework example
