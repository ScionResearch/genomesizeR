PACKAGE:
- Joane to check that dbs are all good through methods comparison from the example using the package
Make databases and models available online (Celine) 
- Run methods on validation set and update method comparison with updated databases (Celine for weighted mean/Joane)
- LMM behaviour: Joane to identifiy threshold to remove lmm estimations above family
- Test on Windows and BFC (Celine)
- Update and check all the documentation, should be ok now (Celine)
- Document more the output in vignette
- Do the R checks, ok but do again before publishing (Celine)
- Clean committed files (Celine)
- Behaviour is weird with multithreaded (takes longer instead of shorter??) (Celine)
- One day maybe: 
    - add rank match info for lmm and bayesian methods
    - scripts to build db and bayesian models from scratch (Celine)
    - Re-do model selection on Bayesian method with final db version (Joane -> do after pre-print)

PAPER PREPRINT:
- add small section comparing methods on example - within example section? make a table summarizing pros and cons of each method
- re-float figures to the right place (Joane)
- author list: add Steve and Loretta?
- show boxplot?


PAPER FINAL
- update methods comparisons with validation with new figures from updated databases (Joane)
- could check correlation with variables from original paper
