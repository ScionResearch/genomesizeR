PACKAGE:
- solve Git data over limit issue (IT)
- Update taxdump (Celine) (waiting for push)
- fix error when selecting Bayesian method with new taxdump / Fix issue with /tmp files not updating (replace 'if exists' check by remove/re-untar?) (Celine)
- Taxdump structure check (Celine)
- re-run models with new taxdump (Celine/Joane)
- update methods comparison with results with new taxdump (Joane)
- rename "hierarchical" method to "lmm" (Celine) (waiting for push / double check)
- Make output similar across methods:
    - concordant columns (Celine) (check format)
    - fixed query column for weighted_mean output (Celine)
- change/update Bayesian method to incorporate uncertainty at the species level (as is done with LMM) (maybe use db used for bayesian)
- Test on Windows and BFC (Celine)
- Clean/handle prerequisites (Celine)
- Update Usage doc (Celine)
- Look into tree plot colours
- Double check how ref db is built and what it means for INFO_NODE check (and document)
- One day maybe: scripts to build db and bayesian models from scratch


PAPER:
- update methods comparisons with new figures from new taxdump (Joane)
- for pandoc compilation: change multiline equations into align* (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63350182/pandoc-not-generating-new-lines-in-markdown-with-latex) (Joane) (probably waiting for push)
- re-float figures to the right place (Joane)
- for pandoc compilation: in example, get code to fit into page (Celine)
- get intro from Steve
- update references (from Steve's blurb? + do we need to cite anything related to NCBI?)
- remove template/instruction sections
- finish/rework example
